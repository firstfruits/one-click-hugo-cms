I rake the fallen camellias

Which lie upon the ground

They’ve flowered their youth;

Bloomed their best - in seasonal time

And now they’re spent

To drop and lie upon the ground

No heartache loss;

In reasoning why some remain and others not,

Why some keep their grip and others drop

I rake the fallen camellias

Which lie upon the ground

Each speaks their truth to me

From colour beholden by the eye

To brown and spent where they lie

Each with no thought of own;

Did bud and bloom in season upon their given tree

And now drop as fertilizer for the ground

Postscript:

Many years ago Isaiah expressed his reflection on life with this thought;

Our natural lives will fade as grass does when it becomes brown and dry.

All our greatness is like a flower that droops and falls; but the word of the Lord will last for ever
