Mood swings - are common to us all;

The weather changes like my mood

As I contemplate life at noon.

I wonder if the rain today

Has a message plain & true.

For when the sky is grey & black

And the wind is beating back

I wonder if the pain I sense

Is mere human circumstance?

Now the sunshine maybe a clue.

Behind every cloud of doubt

There’s a ray of sunlight hiding out.

That’s the same with moods,

I need to sort truth from fiction

Before I continue with my direction.

Consequences of my thoughts

Will mean more or nought

To my living richly or poorly

Today & tomorrow.  For surely

Everything depends upon

My mood swing – now & the future!
